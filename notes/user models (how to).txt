1. Iniside models.py file of the app, add the following line.
----
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
----
This imports User class which is what we see when we login from the admin page of our website.

2. Next we need to create our own models for our user profile.
3. In our example we are going to be using an ImageField to save user's profile picture into our media folder.
4. To be able to use images, we are going to need pillow(a python imaging library)
----
pip install pillow
----

5. Next after creating the model, we register it to admin by adding the following line to admin.py
----
from <app_name>.models import <model_name>


admin.site.register(<model_name>)
----
