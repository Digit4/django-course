1. For django to authorize users, we need to check whether the settings.py file has the following apps installed or not.
----
'django.contrib.admin',
'django.contrib.auth',
'django.contrib.contenttypes',
----
2. Install the following using pip install commands to make your passwords more secure.
----
pip install bcrypt
pipinstall django[argon2]
----
3. Inside settings.py, create a new variable called PASSWORD_HASHERS = list()
4. Inside the password hasher, type the following code:
----
'django.contrib.auth.hashers.Argon2PasswordHasher',
'django.contrib.auth.hashers.BCrypt2SHA256PasswordHasher',
'django.contrib.auth.hashers.BCryptPasswordHasher',
'django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2SHA1PasswordHasher',
'django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2PasswordHasher',
----

5. Next we need to make the template,static file directories in out project folder if they dont exist yet and add them to our settings.py file as we've learned before.
6. Next we need one another folder called media which will be similar to static folder in terms of functionality, but will differ in one aspect
For ex: media folder will contain files that the user will add to the server for his own use, for example profile picture uploaded by the user.

7. Next to add the media file to be recignized by our project, add the following code at the bottom of the settings.py file.
----
# Media file directory config
MEDIA_ROOT = MEDIA_DIR
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
----
