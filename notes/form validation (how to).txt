1. go to forms.py file and include:
----
from django-core import validators
----

2. Check documentation for different kinds of default validators. pick one and to apply,
pass them as parameters to fields in the forms.
ex -
----
class NewForm(forms.Form):
	name = forms.CharField(validators=[checkz])
----

3. To catch bot scripts adding fake data into your forms, we need to check whether the forms are being tampered with or not.
to do that, we need to add a hiddden field in the form class which can be done as follows:
----
class NewForm(forms.Form):
	botcatcher = forms.CharField(required=False, widget=forms.HiddenInput, validators=[validators.<validator_name>])
	# required = False will make the field non requirement so form can be submitted when it is empty.
	# widget=forms.HiddenInput hides the charfield instead of showing it as a field in the form.
	# validators is an array which will contain multiple validators if needed and can be passed in a list format.
----

to clean out all data from the form with specific format for eg, whether email and verifyemail match or not, we use clean() function definition to do it.
----
def clean(self):
		all_clean_data = super().clean()
		email = all_clean_data['email']
		v_mail = all_clean_data["verify_email"]
		if (email != v_mail):
			raise forms.ValidationError("emails do not match")
