1. Create a templates directory in the project's base folder
2. Create the app specific folder inside the templates folder
3. Create the .html file which will be the template. (the file should contain proper template tag/variable)
4. Go to settings.py and with the help of python's os module, we can add the template directory into the appropriate template dictionary key:value pair.
(using os.path.join())
5. Now go to the views.py file and inside a function, create a dictionary with the dynamic content in a key: value pair fashion.
6. Now use the render() function to return the dynamic content inside the dynamically written webage template
(Syntax for render function is as follows:
	render(request,"<path>",context=<dictionary>)
	request: it is the parameter taken by the function(as per norm).
	<path>: is the file directory location where the .html file template is present.
	<dictionary>: is the dictionary with key value pairs of custom dynamically generated content.
