1. Create a base template html file (lets call it base.html)
2. Inside  the base.html file, you'll write all the code that you wish to inherit into other html templates.
3. Then add the following code where the code template will contain the page specific content.
----
{%block body_block%}
<!-- Anything inside these tags will be inherited if you extend this file into other files.-->
{%endblock%}
----
4. Now create the file this template will inherit.
5. Inside the html file you've just created, add the following code.
<!DOCTYPE html>
{%extends '<app_name>/<base_file>.html'%}
	{%block body_block%}
	<!--Your html content specific to this page goes in here.-->
	{%endblock%}
