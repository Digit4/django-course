1. Create a forms.py file inside the app of your choice
2. add the following boiler plate code:
----
from django import forms

class FormName(forms.Form):
	name = forms.CharField()
	email = forms.EmailField()
	text = forms.TextField(widget=forms.TextArea)
----

3. Now inside the views.py of the app, we'll import the forms.py file.
----
from <app_name>.forms import FormName
OR
from . import forms # '.' represents current directory in which views.py is present.
----

4. Now we need to create a view for it
----
def form_view(request):
	form = FormName()
	return render(request,'form_name.html',{'form':form})
