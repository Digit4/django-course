1. Create a forms.py file inside the app of your choice
2. Add the following boiler plate code:
----
from django import forms

class FormName(forms.Form):
	name = forms.CharField()
	email = forms.EmailField()
	text = forms.TextField(widget=forms.TextArea)
----

3. Now inside the views.py of the app, we'll import the forms.py file.
----
from <app_name>.forms import FormName
OR
from . import forms # '.' represents current directory in which views.py is present.
----

4. Now we need to create a view for it
----
def form_view(request):
	form = FormName()
	return render(request,'(from template location)form_name.html',{'form':form})
----

5. Finally add a url for the form_page in urls.py file.

6. Inside templates in order for the form to look pretty, since if we dont' do it the form woll look pretty ugly,
we will add the following code.
----
<div class="container">
	<form method="POST">
		{{form.as_p}} # the as_p will give each element of the form a <p> tag to make it look prettier.
		{% csrf_token %} # cross-site request forgery token helps user/website from having false data entered into the database.
						 # it helps protect HTTP POST Request
						 # form may not work without the token
		<input type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" value="Submit">
	</form>
</div>
----

7. Now that even though we've created the form the form will not get submitted anywhere because the submit button doesnt have an action associated with it.

8. To attach a post method to the submit button, we need to add the following code below the form_view(request) function:
def form_view(request):
	form = FormName()

	# Check if we get a post back from the form
	if request.method == "POST":
		# In which case we pass in that request
		form = forms.FormName(request.POST)

		# Check if the form is valid
		if form.is_valid():
			# Do something
			print("Form Validation Success. Printing entered values in console")
			print("Name:%s" %form.cleaned_data['name'])
			print("Email:%s" %form.cleaned_data['email'])
			print("Text:%s" %form.cleaned_data['text'])

	return render(request,'(from template location)form_name.html',{'form':form})
