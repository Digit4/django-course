1. Create a static folder inside the base project folder.
2. Create an images folder inside the newly created static folder.
3. Add the path to the static folder into the settings.py using,
os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'static')
4. Add a variable (if doesn't exist) called STATICFILES_DIRS as an array for mentioning all the locations where the static files are stored.
and then add the STATIC_DIR into the list as an element.
5. Add the image file into the images folder created in step 2.
(We can now access static files from the server by adding location of the file inside the base folder as address
for example for pic.jpg in the given example, we use 127.0.0.1:8000/static/images/pic.jpg to view the file in the browser)
6. Now we need to add the image tag (if we want to dispay he image in an html file) to the html file to add the file.
7. Now we need to add this piece of code right below <!DOCTYPE html> so we are allowed to access static data inside the html template.
{% load staticfiles %}
8. In the src="" we need to add a sort of template tag like {%<static_content_here>%} so it will look like this:
<img src="{%static '<path_to_image_inside_static_folder>'%}">

9. We can also use static folder to host other kind of files like css,JS files which are not going to be dynamically generated.
10. To do this we need to simply in the <link> tag use template variables in href="".
